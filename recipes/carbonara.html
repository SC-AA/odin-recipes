        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is one of my favorite pasta dishes, made using cured pork, eggs and cheese. Some recipes use cream to add to the sauce, but Italian recipes typically make the sauce out of just the eggs, giving it a rich flavour.
        </p>
        <p>While spaghetti is the shape you'll see the most often, plenty of other shapes like linguine, fusilli and penne can be used as well. Since this delicious dish can be enjoyed alone or with others, it's a good one to learn how to make!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Stepss</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly salt a large pot of water and boil, then cook spaghetti in boiling water for 12 minutes while stirring occasionally. The spaghetti should be tender yet still firm and chewy. Drain the pasta and toss it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then set it aside.</li>
