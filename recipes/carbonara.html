        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is one of my favorite pasta dishes, made using cured pork, eggs and cheese. Some recipes use cream to add to the sauce, but Italian recipes typically make the sauce out of just the eggs, giving it a rich flavour.
        </p>
        <p>While spaghetti is the shape you'll see the most often, plenty of other shapes like linguine, fusilli and penne can be used as well. Since this delicious dish can be enjoyed alone or with others, it's a good one to learn how to make!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly salt a large pot of water and boil, then cook spaghetti in boiling water (approx. 12 minutes) while stirring occasionally. The spaghetti should be tender yet still firm and chewy. Drain the pasta and toss it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then set it aside.</li>
            <li>Put the diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir it until it is evenly browned (approx. 10 minutes). Drain the bacon on paper towels, while reserving 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the bacon fat inn the skillet. Add the chopped onion and cook over medium heat until it becomes translucent, then add minced garlic. Cook until fragrant (approx. 1 minute), then add wine and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Return the cooked bacon to the skillet and add the cooked spaghetti. Toss it to coat and heat it thoroughly. If it sticks together or becomes dry, add more olive oil. Add the beaten eggs and cook while tossing with tongs or a large fork until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and toss again, then season with salt and pepper (note that bacon and Parmesan are salty as well).</li>
            <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top, and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
        </ol>
