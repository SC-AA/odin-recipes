            <li>1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion</li>

            <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
            <li>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
            <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chile-garlic sauce (eg. Sriracha) (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius. Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned (approx. 1 hour). Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft (approx. 45 minutes).</li>
            <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce and 4 quarts water then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour, then drain. When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Drain noodles and divide them into 4 serving bowls, topped with sirloin, cilantro and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top, then stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink (approx. 1 to 2 minutes). Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
